# Genomic_db
This software is used to prepare the input files for EWINDO's Genomic database.
The expected input file is the sequencing report from BGI where the header is #Chr,Loci, REF, series of sample name, and Sequencing Details.
This script partitions the original file into three csv files following the entities format of EWINDO's Genomic database.
